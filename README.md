# FWD_Data_Analysis_Professional
This repository contains my projects for data analysis nano degree offered by Udacity

## 1- US_bikeshare:
    In this project, I will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike     share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC using interactive python code.
